user need to fill the correct OSS information in the file:
CarAssist/carAssist/src/main/java/com/car/control/dvr/OSSLivingActivity.java

for example:

    private String mOSSAccessKey = "xxx";   //ex: "ACSDg19dijfj5Ngs"
    private String mOSSSecretKey = "xxx";   //ex: "ab2HjdkhaHKusdhj1829jkjhagskJ7s"
    private String mEndPoint = "xxx";       //ex: "http://oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com"
    private String mBucket = "xxx";         //ex: "liveshenzhen"
    private String mStreamingFile = "xxx";  //ex: "TWNFC66DRWAAHU9D_1234567890"
    private String mSerialNum = "xxx";  //ex: "TWNFC66DRWAAHU9D"


mOSSAccessKey/mOSSSecretKey should come from aliyun OSS website, it should be fixed.
mEndPoint/mBuckect also come from aliyun OSS website, but it can be changed if you have several oss endpoint in different area.

mStreamingFile MUST be unique for all the living streaming at the same time, otherwise it will cause streaming conflict.
the file name can be anything you like.

mSerialNum is the device serial number from ro.serialno, it MUST be something like "TWNFC66DRWAAHU9D"
